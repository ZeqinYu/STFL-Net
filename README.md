(_In collaboration with **Alibaba Security**_)

> - Parts of **STFD** were adopted in the <br>
>   □ ["2022 Real-World Image Forgery Detection Challenge" (真实场景篡改图像检测挑战赛)](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531945/introduction?spm=5176.12281949.1003.1.c90d2448TlNT6k).  
> - Another subset was used in the ICDAR 2023 competitions, although the organizers have not publicly disclosed the source: <br>
>   □ ["DTT in Images 1: Text Manipulation Classification"](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532048/rankingList) and <br>
